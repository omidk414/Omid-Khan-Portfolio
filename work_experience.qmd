    - Web scrapped several sites using a Python script with Selenium API, efficiently extracting 250k resumes from Outlook, achieving a consistent average of 100 job listings per minute, and collecting an extensive dataset of over 20k job listings weekly from various websites.
    - Automated data extraction processes, resulting in saving of over 80 hours each month, significantly improving productivity and data collection rates.
    - Organized and structured large amounts of data in XLSX format; encompassing attributes such as job titles, company names, locations, detailed job descriptions, and salary information.
    - Ensured quality data extraction and consistency, reducing data preparation time by 70%, facilitating efficient data analysis, and reporting.
    - Implemented data storage procedures, efficiently saving collected data to XLSX files, including a system that dynamically checks and adds missing headers to enhance data management efficiency and eliminate potential errors.
    - Created data transfer pipelines to Blob Storage, delivering a 85% reduction in manual data entry errors.
    - Conducted data preprocessing, systematically removing duplicates, and efficiently categorizing data by industry buckets, enhancing data quality by 80%.
    - Parsed and extracted critical information, including names, job titles, emails, resume contents, and top 5 skills from each resume to train the ML model and in order to generate score cards.
    - Automated scorecard generation, which resulted in 50% reduction in manual effort and saving approximately 15 hours per project cycle.
    - Tailored each score card with personalized information, including names, skills, and skill percentages, maintaining an accuracy rate of 95% in reflecting candidate profiles and skills.
    - Assisted in training the ML model to provide job recommendations and candidates, streamlining  the hiring process and improved candidate matches.


  - Telecom Project (GCP, Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, PowerBI, Docker, ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo Key API, AI/ML, Jupyter Notebooks, Flask):
    - Developed predictive models for a major telecom client to predict cost, utilization or social health, and deployed them on Google Cloud Platform. 
    - Utilized client staging environment to extract consumer data in JSON format for analysis and processing.
    - Integrated ChatGPT API  to the GCP on a PowerBI dashboard. Allows users to ask the chatbot about their multi-tenant dashboard content, issues, etc. 
    - Built the chatbot using Microsoft Virtual Agent (interface for chatbot), and that Agent had an automated flow using Power Automate.
    - Conducted and drove the adoption of enterprise-wide analytics to support strategic execution using prescriptive and predictive analytics with a specialty in the Finance, Quality and Utilization domains.
    - Created visually appealing dashboards for data analysis and visualization using BI and PostgreSQL.
    - Tailored the dashboards to meet client requirements and presented complex data sets in a clear and concise manner.
    - Developed interactive, meaningful and user-friendly dashboards to enable quick identification of key insights and trends.
    - Ensured scalability of dashboards to accommodate additional data.
    - Compiled hyperparameter tuning pipelines for AI/machine learning and deep learning models. The framework enabled the company to train and deploy machine learning models 2 times faster, resulting in a 25% improvement in prediction accuracy.       


  - AIoT Project (Python, Raspberry PI, OpenCV, Tensorflow, Keras):
    - Designed an AIOT solution to an client that created an online platform to teach programming in the classroom for over 50 colleges in India.
    - Developed object detection and recognition modules for a manufacturing facility, resulting in a 40% reduction in manual labor and a 20% increase in operational efficiency.
    - Obtained data sets off Kaggle, and GitHub repositories to train the model.
    - Created an ETL pipeline using Python, and preprocessed the data to find null values.
    - Collaborated on the integration of IR sensors for real-time object recognition and tracking, streamlining manufacturing processes and improving productivity.
    - Assisted in the design and implementation of an ultrasonic sensor module for precise object placement, achieving a 15% reduction in errors.
    - Utilized advanced data science techniques to analyze sensor data, leading to a 25% reduction in equipment downtime.
    - Trained object detection models using Keras and TensorFlow, enabling the system to detect objects and display their coordinates, colors, and shapes accurately.
    - Utilized data science techniques to analyze sensor data, identifying patterns and anomalies for predictive maintenance, resulting in a 15% decrease in equipment downtime.
    - Performed thorough testing and validation of the sensor modules, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and seamless integration into the clients platform. 


- **Data Analyst (Center for Student Research)**
