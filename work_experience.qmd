    - Spearheaded web scraping initiatives, efficiently extracting a remarkable 200,000 to 500,000 resumes from Outlook, achieving a consistent average of 100 job listings per minute, and collecting an extensive dataset of over 20,000 job listings weekly from various websites.
    - Automated data extraction processes, resulting in time-saving of over 80 hours each month, significantly improving productivity and data collection rates.
    - Organized and structured large amounts of data, processing and managing around 10,000 job listings per week, encompassing attributes such as job titles, company names, locations, detailed job descriptions, and salary information.
    - Ensured quality data extraction and consistency, reducing data preparation time by 70%, facilitating efficient data analysis, and reporting.
    - Implemented data storage procedures, efficiently saving collected data to XLSX files, including a system that dynamically checks and adds missing headers to enhance data management efficiency and eliminate potential errors.
    - Created data transfer pipelines to Blob Storage, delivering a remarkable 85% reduction in manual data entry errors, saving over 300 hours annually.
    - Conducted data preprocessing, systematically removing duplicates, and efficiently categorizing data by industry buckets, ultimately enhancing data quality by 80%.
    - Parsed and extracted critical information, including names, job titles, emails, resume contents, and top 5 skills from each resume to train the ML model and in order to generate score cards.
    - Automated scorecard generation, achieving a substantial 80% reduction in manual effort and saving approximately 15 hours per project cycle.
    - Tailored each score card with personalized information, including names, skills, and skill percentages, maintaining an accuracy rate of 100% in reflecting candidate profiles and skills.
    - Assisted in training the ML model to provide job recommendations and candidates, which significantly streamlined the hiring process and improved candidate matches.
  
  - Telecom Project (Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, PowerBI, Docker, GCP, ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo Key, AI/ML, Jupyter Notebooks):
    - Developed predictive models for a major telecom client to predict cost, utilization or social health, and deployed them on Google Cloud Platform.
    - Integrated ChatGPT AI chatbot to the GCP on the PowerBI dashboard. Allows users to ask the chatbot about their dashboard content, issues, etc.
    - Built the chatbot using Microsoft Virtual Agent (interface for chatbot), and that Agent had an automated flow using Power Automate.
    - Conducted and drove the adoption of enterprise-wide analytics to support strategic execution using prescriptive and predictive analytics with a specialty in the Finance, Quality and Utilization domains.
    - Created visually appealing dashboards for data analysis and visualization using BI and PostgreSQL.
    - Tailored the dashboards to meet client requirements and presented complex data sets in a clear and concise manner.
    - Developed interactive, meaningful and user-friendly dashboards to enable quick identification of key insights and trends.
    - Ensured scalability of dashboards to accommodate additional data.
    - Compiled hyperparameter tuning pipelines for AI/machine learning and deep learning models. The framework enabled the company to train and deploy machine learning models 2 times faster, resulting in a 25% improvement in prediction accuracy.

  - IoT Project (Python, Raspberry PI, OpenCV, Tensorflow, Keras):
    - Developed object detection and recognition modules for a manufacturing facility, resulting in a 40% reduction in manual labor and a 20% increase in operational efficiency.
    - Obtained data sets off Kaggle, and github repositories to train the model.
    - Created an ETL pipeline in python, and preprocessed the data to find null values.
    - Collaborated on the integration of IR sensors for real-time object recognition and tracking, streamlining manufacturing processes and improving productivity.
    - Assisted in the design and implementation of an ultrasonic sensor module for precise object placement, achieving a 15% reduction in errors.
    - Utilized advanced data science techniques to analyze sensor data, leading to a 25% reduction in equipment downtime.
    - Trained object detection models using Keras and TensorFlow, enabling the system to detect objects and display their coordinates, colors, and shapes accurately.
    - Utilized data science techniques to analyze sensor data, identifying patterns and anomalies for predictive maintenance, resulting in a 15% decrease in equipment downtime.
    - Performed thorough testing and validation of the sensor modules, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and seamless integration into the client's platform.
